This is an installer script for KenT2's 'Pi Presents KMS' (v1.6 branch)

It very simply uses shell commands to run through all the install steps on the install section of that repo plus then adding some extras that I find useful.

It is intended that the Raspberry Pis receiving this live offline but SAMBA, SSH and VNC does get enabled if you run all the commands to allow for easy control and distribution of media files over a network connection.
